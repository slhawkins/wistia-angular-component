# Angular Component for Wistia

This component provides a simple interface for uploading video's to Wistia. It uses the [Blueimp File Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) plugin as well as [Wistia's Upload API](https://wistia.com/doc/upload-api). To use this, you must have a API password from Wistia. It can be passed to the component in the element tag as such:

```html
<wistia-uploader api-password="04b3d79b5862199549a1786e0bd302094e3c704bc40a23e691d55082d5508ga1"></wistia-uploader>
```
